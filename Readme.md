|--------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1.5.x              | 1.5.x          |  [release/1.5.2]    |                    |   5.3 or greater    |

## Requirements

1. PHP version (check Module version guide)
2. TLS 1.2 & cURL 1.0.1c

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has mandated that early versions of
TLS be retired from service. All organizations that handle credit card information
are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, Stripe has
upgraded its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections.
Connections to the sandbox environment use only TLS 1.2.

For more official, relevant information, see the 2017-2018 Merchant Security
Roadmap Microsite:
* [TLS 1.2 and HTTP/1.1 Upgrade Microsite][4]

Check the version of your URLâ€™s underlying security library. If you use OpenSSL
libraries, please update them to at least version 1.0.1c.

## Compiling assets

In order to compile those files, you must :  
1. have _Node 10+_ installed locally
2. run `npm install` in the root folder to install dependencies
3. then run `npm run watch` to compile assets and watch for file changes

Run `npm run build` to compile for production.  
Files are minified, `console.log` and comments dropped.
